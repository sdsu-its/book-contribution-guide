# Contribution Guide

All of our projects at San Diego State University - Instructional Technology Services are open source, and licensed in such a way that permits, and even encourages, contributions and improvements. Depending on the scope of your contributions, and your knowledge of Git, you can make your contributions via the GitHub website, or via Git.

This guide assumes that you are NOT an owner or member of the merge-approval team on the GitHub repo.
